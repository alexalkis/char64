#Char64
## Synopsis

An application to edit fonts for the Commodore 64.

## Installation

You'll need qt4 or qt5 development packages.

By running (in a terminal)
```
qmake
make
```
should probably leave you with a char64 executable.

Alternatively open with Qt-Creator the char64.pro file and build.
